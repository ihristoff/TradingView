Daily Changes: Shows the day-to-day changes in basis points as green/red columns.
Cumulative Changes: Tracks the 20-day cumulative change in basis points as a blue line.

How to Use It

Technical Notes

The DV01 values are approximations and may vary slightly based on the current yield environment
Contract specifications (face value, price increments) are built into the indicator
The indicator accounts for the different price quotation conventions of Treasury futures

Interpretation

Positive values indicate yield decreases (price increases)
Negative values indicate yield increases (price decreases)
The magnitude shows how many basis points the underlying yield has moved

This indicator gives you a standardized way to compare moves across different parts of the yield curve, making it easier to spot relative value opportunities or analyze curve flattening/steepening trades.
